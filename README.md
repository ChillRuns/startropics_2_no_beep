# Zoda's Revenge: StarTropics II No Beep ROM hack

I was talking to my friend about StarTropics, and they mentioned that this
sequel is great except for the annoying alert that happens when Mike is at low
health. I decided to try to patch it out, and now we have a beepless _Zoda's
Revenge._

You can get it [here](https://github.com/ChillRuns/startropics_2_no_beep/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.zip).

You can also [watch the stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqh7Z2shCOc)
where I isolated and patched the beep code.

# Usage

To use this patch, you need the original ROM for the game. Then use an IPS
patch tool, such as [flips](https://github.com/Alcaro/Flips), to apply the
patch and generate a new ROM.
